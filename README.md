**scbirlab/nf-ont-call-variants** is a Nextflow pipeline to call variants 
from Nanopore FASTQ files from bacterial clones relative to a wildtype control.

The pipeline broadly recapitualtes, where possible, the GATK best practices for 
germline short variant calling, with some changes for bacterial genomes and long-read
sequencing.

## Processing steps

For each sample:

1. Quality Trim reads using `cutadapt`. 
2. Map to genome FASTA using `minimap2`.
3. Call variants with `Clair3`.

Then merge resulting GVCFs using GATK `CombineGVCFs`. With the combined variant calls:

5. Annotate variant effects using `snpEff`.
6. Filter out variants where all samples have identical variants (important to have a wild-type control here).
7. Write to output TSV.

### Other steps

1. Get FASTQ quality metrics with `fastqc`.
2. Generate alignment statistics and plots with `samtools stats` and `mosdepth`.
2. Map to genome FASTA using `bowtie2` because `minimap2` logs are not compatible with `multiqc`. This way, some kind of alignment metrics are possible.
3. Compile the logs of processing steps into an HTML report with `multiqc`.

## Requirements

### Software

You need to have Nextflow and either Conda, Singularity, or Docker installed on your system.

#### First time using Nextflow?

If you're at the Crick or your shared cluster has it already installed, try:

```bash
module load Nextflow Singularity
```

Otherwise, if it's your first time using Nextflow on your system and you have Conda installed, you can install it using `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nextflow 
```

You may need to set the `NXF_HOME` environment variable. For example,

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.nextflow
export NXF_HOME=~/.nextflow
```

To make this a permanent change, you can do something like the following:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.nextflow
echo "export NXF_HOME=~/.nextflow" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Quick start

Make a [sample sheet (see below)](#sample-sheet) and, optionally, 
a [`nextflow.config` file](#inputs) in the directory where you want the 
pipeline to run. Then run Nextflow.

```bash 
nextflow run scbirlab/nf-ont-call-variants
```

Each time you run the pipeline after the first time, Nextflow will use a 
locally-cached version which will not be automatically updated. If you want 
to ensure that you're using the very latest version of the pipeline, use 
the `-latest` flag.

```bash 
nextflow run scbirlab/nf-ont-call-variants -latest
```

If you want to run a particular tagged version of the pipeline, such as `v0.0.2`, you can do so using

```bash 
nextflow run scbirlab/nf-ont-call-variants -r v0.0.2
```

For help, use `nextflow run scbirlab/nf-ont-call-variants --help`.

The first time you run the pipeline for a project, the software dependencies 
in `environment.yml` will be installed. This may take several minutes.

## Inputs

The following parameters are required:

- `sample_sheet`: path to a CSV with information about the samples and FASTQ files to be processed

The following parameters have default values which can be overridden if necessary.

- `inputs = "inputs"` : The folder containing your inputs (i.e. sequencing reads). It's likely you'll want to change this one.
- `trim_qual = 10` : For `cutadapt`, the minimum Phred score for trimming 3' calls
- `min_length = 10` : For `cutadapt`, the minimum trimmed length of a read. Shorter reads will be discarded

The following options do not need to be changed, but can be overridden if you decide you need to:
- `gatk_image = "docker://broadinstitute/gatk:latest"` : Which GATK4 image to use
- `snpeff_url = "https://snpeff.blob.core.windows.net/versions/snpEff_latest_core.zip"` : Where to download snpEff from
- `clair3_image = "docker://hkubal/clair3:latest"` : Which Clair3 image to use
- `rerio_url = "https://github.com/nanoporetech/rerio.git"`: Where to find the Rerio repository
- `clair3_model = "r1041_e82_400bps_sup_v500"`: Which basecalling model to use with Clair3

The parameters can be provided either in the `nextflow.config` file or on the `nextflow run` command.

Here is an example of the `nextflow.config` file:

```nextflow
params {
    sample_sheet = "/path/to/sample-sheet.csv"
    inputs = "/path/to/inputs"
}
```

Alternatively, you can provide the parameters on the command line:

```bash
nextflow run scbirlab/nf-ont-call-variants \
    --sample_sheet /path/to/sample-sheet.csv \
    --inputs /path/to/inputs
``` 

### Sample sheet

The sample sheet is a CSV file providing information about which FASTQ files belong to which sample.

The file must have a header with the column names below, and one line per sample to be processed.

- `sample_id`: the unique name of the sample. The wildtype must be **named so that it is alphabetically last**
- `reads`: path (relative to `inputs` option above) to compressed FASTQ files derived from Nanopore sequencing
- `genome_accession`: NCBI genome accession number of the reference, starting with "GCF_" or "GCA_". You can look it up [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/).

You can also add additional columns for annotation, e.g. `strain_name`, if you like for later ease of reference.

Here is an example of the sample sheet:

| sample_id | reads                    | genome_accession |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | 
| wt        | raw_reads_wt_*.fastq.gz  | GCF_000015005.1  | 
| mut1      | raw_reads_mut_*.fastq.gz | GCF_000015005.1  | 

## Outputs

Outputs are saved in the same directory as `sample_sheet`. They are organised under three directories:

- `processed`: FASTQ files and logs resulting from alignments
- `tables`: tables, plots, and VCF files corresponding to variant calls
- `multiqc`: HTML report on processing steps
